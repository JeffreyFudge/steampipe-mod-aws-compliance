## Description

AWS console defaults to no check boxes selected when creating a new IAM user. When creating the IAM User credentials you have to determine what type of access they require.

Programmatic access: The IAM user might need to make API calls, use the AWS CLI, or use the Tools for Windows PowerShell. In that case, create an access key (access key ID and a secret access key) for that user.

AWS Management Console access: If the user needs to access the AWS Management Console, create a password for the user.

## Remediation

Perform the following to delete access keys that do not pass the audit:

### From Console:

1. Log into the AWS Management Console:
2. Click `Services`.
3. Click `IAM`.
4. Click on `Users`.
5. Click on `Security Credentials`.
6. As an Administrator

- Click on the X (`Delete`) for keys that were created at the same time as the user profile but have not been used.

7. As an IAM User

- Click on the X (`Delete`) for keys that were created at the same time as the user profile but have not been used.

### From Command Line:

```bash
aws iam delete-access-key --access-key-id <access-key-id-listed> --user-name <users-name>
```

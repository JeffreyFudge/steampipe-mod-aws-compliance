## Description

IAM users are granted access to services, functions, and data through IAM policies. There are four ways to define policies for a user: 1) Edit the user policy directly, aka an inline, or user, policy; 2) attach a policy directly to a user; 3) add the user to an IAM group that has an attached policy; 4) add the user to an IAM group that has an inline policy.

Only the third implementation is recommended.

## Remediation

Perform the following to create an IAM group and assign a policy to it:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.
2. In the navigation pane,click `Groups` and then click `Create New Group`.
3. In the `Group Name` box,type the name of the group and then click `Next Step`.
4. In the list of policies, select the check box for each policy that you want to apply to all members of the group. Then click `Next Step`.
5. Click `Create Group`

Perform the following to remove a direct association between an user and the policy:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.
2. In the left navigation pane, click on Users
3. For each user:
  + Select the user
  + Click on the `Permissions` tab
  + Expand `Permissions policies`
  + Click `X` for each policy; then click Detach or Remove (depending on policy type)
